                My grandma's (mom's mom's) side is Mennonite. The Mennonites are a religious group which descended from 
                the Anabaptists, similar to Hutterites and the Amish. You can take a look around online for the details 
                of the religion, the religion's beliefs, and their larger history, but recently I've been thinking about
                this side of my family and how much we've moved around and left our communities behind. My original 
                Mennonite ancestors were likely from the Netherlands or nothern Germany, many of whom were forced to leave 
                due to religious persecution. A large group, which nowadays is called the Russian Mennonites but who spoke 
                a form of German, ended up 
                moving to the Vistula Delta area in modern day Poland. A couple hundred years later, they took an offer
                from Catherine the Great of Russia to settle "New Russia" in what is now southern Ukraine. My family 
                specifically lived in/near Odesa, Ukraine.

                Now we get to my specific family history. My great grandma Rita left the Mennonite community to marry a 
                non-Mennonite man (scandalous!) who was a Soviet engineer. They had one child (my grandma Lina). Lina's 
                dad left to Russia to work and she was separated from Rita, possibly due to health issues, resulting in 
                Lina ending up in an orphanage. Her grandma from the Mennonite community eventually found her and brought
                her back there, before taking the family to the Neuland Colony in Paraguay to escape Europe due to 
                Religious persecution and a purge of German descendents and German speakers from Russia. Eventually,
                a family member who was a nurse working in Canada was able to sponsor the family, and they moved to Delta,
                BC, where a large group of my Mennonite family still lives. Lina, however, left the community and married
                my grandpa, and they lived together and had children together in Burnaby. My mom ended up being the only
                one of her siblings to leave Burnaby long-term, moving to Vancouver Island, where I was born. Now I live 
                in Vancouver and am contemplating my career and my future and where it will take me!

                One aspect of this history is colonization. While Mennonites have often been forced to move to survive, they
                have still taken part in colonization in the areas they settle. One example of Mennonite colonization that I 
                learned about while researching this topic is environmental damage in Latin America. My family lived in 
                Paraguay briefly, but other Mennonites colonized as well, and many stayed there. Many Mennonites historically 
                made a 
                living through agriculture since they were skilled farmers, sometimes even settling and farming in areas with
                poor soil that no one else could farm. This tradition continued in South America, where their clearing of 
                land for farming has contributed to the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest.
